# TO-LEARN LIST 
(No puppy was killed, I swear :P) 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I installed some dependencies such as: redux, @reduxjs/toolkit, react-redux; miragejs (mock API tools), faker and seedrandom. 

The project is still going on. All functions about create new item, delete single item, change color of an item, delete all completed items, mark all complete are done and run smoothly. However, filtering functions are not worked yet! I will come back to fix these later.
